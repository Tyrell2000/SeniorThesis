            <a>Hello all! Welcome to the website! The purpose of this website is to serve as a place where you can easily access data on historical time periods that were significant to the Germanic region. You will find a number of historical article-style readings to enjoy. As many academic readings are dense and articles without peer-review could be misinformative, each reading will comprise of textual data that has been summarized and simplified from multiple sources, in order to show only the most important and impactful moments, decisions and outcomes throughout each time period. Since it is also hard to gain a deep understanding of a subject when you can't visualize the subject matter, each reading will also contain multiple images to help give you a better understanding of the geography, alliances and territorial shifts addressed in the text.</a>

                <h2>30 Years' War (1618 - 1648)</h2>
                <p>The 30 Years' War, also known as the religious wars, would redefine the religious landscape of Europe, allowing for the spread of non-catholic Christian denominations in Europe and their colonies. This would also serve to severely weaken the power of Austria, the pre-eminent German power at the time, and pave the way for the beginning of Prussia's rise to eventually becoming the pre-eminent German power, surpassing Austria.</p>

                    <p>The Zollverein would serve as the first customs union in history to unite independent sovereign nations across international borders. This would allow for Prussian political and economic sway to rapidly rise in a relatively short period of time and eventually help Prussia to unite Germany, sans Austria-Hungary.</p>

                <h2>World War 1 (1914 - 1918)</h2>
                <p>This war would serve to redefine military campaigns and the nature of war, from fast-paced wars with a few key majo battles into more exhaustive and longer, more draining wars. This war would also lead to the collapse of the Russian and Austro-Hungarian Empires. The treaty that would be enforced on Germany after their defeat would eventually lead to World War 2.</p>

                <p>This war would be the result of a mixture of the rise of Nazism and the terms of the treaty enforced on Germany after their defeat in World War 1. This war would devastate Europe and the world at large. This war would also lead to the rise of Communism in Europe and other regions of the world and lead to the Era known as the Cold War.</p>
